# Network-based-candidate-gene-predictor
My individual software project under the course Special Topics In Bioinformatics.
Based on file handling, Hishigaki and Majority Voting algorithms.
Functionalities: •	Construct network graph related to the input file
•	Based on two algorithms namely ‘Majority voting score’ and ‘Hishigaki algorithm’ where the user can select the preferred algorithm.
•	Predict candidate genes for identified functionalities in the network from proteins with unknown functionalities greater than 80th percentile of the scores.
•	Predict for multiple functionalities from unknown proteins in the network.
•	Predict most accurate functionality for each protein.
•	Taxonomy specific. (Here used taxon is Arabidopsis thaliana)


Future improvements

•	User to specify taxon 
•	Connect to a data base and improve annotations for references for all available taxons
•	Add a progress bar while user waits for results
