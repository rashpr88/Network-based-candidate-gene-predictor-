# Network-based-candidate-gene-predictor
The objective of this project is to utilize file handling, Hishigaki, and Majority Voting algorithms to offer various features, such as the ability to generate a network graph from the input file. Users can choose between two algorithms, Majority Voting and Hishigaki, to predict candidate proteins for identified functionalities in the network from proteins with unknown functionalities. The software can also forecast multiple functionalities for unknown proteins and accurately determine their most likely functionality. Additionally, the program is tailored to be taxonomy-specific, with Arabidopsis thaliana being the chosen taxon.
